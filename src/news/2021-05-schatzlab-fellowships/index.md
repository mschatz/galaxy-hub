**We are very pleased to announce that the [Michael Schatz Lab](https://schatz-lab.org/) at Johns Hopkins University has stepped forward to fund conference fellowships for the [2021 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2021)](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition).**  These fellowships cover all conference registration costs, and are available to students and post-docs anywhere in the world.

GCC2021 will be held June 28 through July 10, and features a week of training, a 3 day conference, and a multi-day CollaborationFest.  It is an excellent venue for sharing your work and learning how others are addressing challenges in data-intensive science.  The Training Week and CoFest will run around-the-clock, and the meeting content will be offered twice daily, 9 hours apart.  *Geography will not be a barrier to participating in GCC2021.*

But GCC2021 is only an excellent opportunity if you are able to participate.  *These fellowships ensure that cost will also not be a barrier to participating.*

Fellowship applications are open until May 24.  If you are a student or post-doc working in data-intensive science then you are strongly encouraged to apply.  The application is brief.

The [Schatz Lab](https://schatz-lab.org/) focuses on understanding the structure and function of genomes, especially those of medical or agricultural importance. Their core goal is to develop novel algorithms and computational systems for large-scale biological sequence analysis, including leading algorithms for de novo genome assembly, variant detection, and related â€“omics assays.

Michael Schatz is a Bloomberg Distinguished Associate Professor of Computer Science and Biology at Johns Hopkins.  In 2020 Mike became a Galaxy Project PI when he stepped into the void left by [James Taylor's unexpected passing](/src/jxtx/indes.md).  Mike is also a project lead for [AnVIL](https://anvilproject.org/), a large NHGRI-funded effort in which Galaxy is a key component.
