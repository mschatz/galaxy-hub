**[2021 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2021)](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition)  will be held 28 June through July 10, and will be [virtual, affordable, and globally accessible](/src/news/2021-02-gcc-virtual/index.md).**

GCC2021 features a 3 day conference, 6-8 July, with talks, Q&A, posters, demos, bird-of-a-feather, and plenty of networking.  All meeting events will be repeated twice daily, 9 hours apart, making this event accessible to the world.  All events, except for talks will be live in both time slots.  GCC2021 is preceded by a [week of training](/src/events/gcc2021/training/index.md), and is followed by a multi-day CoFest, where the community gathers to improve the Galaxy ecosystem, and to expand the community of Galaxy contributors.

# Registration is Open, *and it is Very Affordable!*

The move to virtual has allowed the conference to slash registration rates to a fraction of what an in-person event would cost.  The virtual format also makes the conference globally accessible.

Registration rates depend on where you are in your career, and where you are in the world.  *In addition, please also consider [applying for a Galaxy Community Fund GCC2021 Conference Fellowship](/src/news/2021-04-gcc-fellowships/index.md), or for a [Schatz Lab GCC2021 Conference Fellowship](/src/news/2021-05-schatzlab-fellowships/index.md).*
